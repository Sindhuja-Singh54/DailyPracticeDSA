Q

Sum of all prime numbers between 1 and N.

Given a positive integer N, find the sum of all prime numbers between 1 and N(inclusive).
 

Example 1:

Input: N = 5
Output: 10
Explanation: 2, 3, and 5 are prime
numbers between 1 and 5(inclusive).


Example 2:

Input: N = 10
Output: 17
Explanation: 2, 3, 5 and 7 are prime
numbers between 1 and 10(inclusive).

Ans

 public long prime_Sum(int n)
    {
         boolean prime[]=new boolean[n + 1];
      
        Arrays.fill(prime, true);
      
        for (int p = 2; p * p <= n; p++) {
      
            if (prime[p] == true) {
      
                for (int i = p * 2; i <= n; i += p)
                    prime[i] = false;
            }
        }
      
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
            if (prime[i])
                sum += i;
        return sum;
    }
